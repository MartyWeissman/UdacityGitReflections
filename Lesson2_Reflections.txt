Lesson 2 reflections

1.  What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git directory with metadata.  This will allow Git to perform version control on the repository.

2.  How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's intermediate between the working directory and the repository.  It offers the ability to commit only some of the files to the repository, I think.
